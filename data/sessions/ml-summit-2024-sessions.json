      "title": "Bias Detection and Mitigation in Machine Learning Systems",
      "speaker": "Prof. Angela Williams",
      "youtubeUrl": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=59bMh59JQDo",
      "summary": "This session addresses one of the most critical challenges in modern AI: identifying, measuring, and mitigating bias in machine learning systems. Professor Williams presents systematic approaches to bias detection across different types of ML models and applications. The presentation covers statistical methods for measuring fairness, techniques for bias-aware data collection and preprocessing, and algorithmic approaches to fair machine learning. Key topics include demographic parity, equalized odds, and individual fairness metrics. Real-world case studies demonstrate how bias manifests in hiring algorithms, credit scoring systems, and healthcare AI, along with successful mitigation strategies. Attendees will learn practical tools and frameworks for building more equitable AI systems while maintaining model performance and business objectives.",
